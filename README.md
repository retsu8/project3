Inventory Management system with DAT files;


Thoug incomplete, I am like how the mapping function worked out here, along with the string agregation for th key functionality.

This inventory itself could use multiple enhancements such as login handling, mysql/sql backends/ fragmentation sets/ additional inventory typing/ product description/ product class handling.

For this, I can insto an issue in how strings would hash when passing them into pointers, this was eventually resolved via making sure the string was static in its content when passed.  

All skill for this project will transfer as being able to properly lint code, work with classes, and conceptionalize the code bases use are usefull.

Variable names mean what they should, comments are direct and to the point, functions and classes tell what they do. The link here helps with this.
